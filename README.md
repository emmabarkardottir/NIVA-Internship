## English commentary:
Human activities in Danish waters have intensified, putting increasing pressure on biodiversity and fish populations. Intensive and continuous fisheries have significantly impacted fish stocks, with many showing signs of overexploitation. Establishing a balance between a healthy ecosystem and sustainable fisheries is essential.

Fish quotas, designed to regulate the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), aim to prevent overfishing. However, discrepancies between quotas and landings (fish brought ashore) often reveal gaps in regulation adherence and sustainability challenges. The relationship between quotas, landings, and fishing intensity over time highlights whether fish species are overexploited or sustainably managed. A framework to evaluate fishing efforts against MSY thresholds, categorizing sustainability on a "good" to "poor" scale, helps identify overexploited species over time, giving historical trends.

This project aims to develop a draft index to assess the sustainability of fisheries in relation to MSY thresholds. By integrating data on quotas, landings, and fishing intensity, the index will identify areas where overfishing occurs for specific species. This will be presented as an interactive map of Danish waters and the Baltic Sea, highlighting fishing regions, species affected, fishing intensity, and sustainability status. This tool will provide a clear overview of overfished areas and serve as a basis for addressing unsustainable practices and promoting effective solutions.

This project will be done in collaboration with **NIVA Denmark**, where the student will work from their offices in Copenhagen.
